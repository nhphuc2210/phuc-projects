### **Job Descriptions:**
<br />


    I need to compare two to three data sources 
    on a recurring basis to make sure they match. 
    
    All data sources are Excel files. 
    
    If there are mismatches, I need a list of discrepancies that is easy to read     and understand. 
    
    If you want to use Python to manipulate the Excel files and create a GUI for me to use, that would work. 
    
    I'd be happy to discuss other approaches.
